    "instructions.motivation.description": "The motivation arises from a discussion about whether a joke, or humor in general, can cause harm. There are those who maintain that no one should be offended by a joke, other people believe that certain humor fuels social violence. It is a reality that there are disadvantaged groups that need emotional support from society, and it is also true that humor can be a tool to overcome difficult situations. Where is the limit? Joke-O-Meter aims to approach the problem from a kind point of view, without forgetting that humor is a powerful tool that can be used to cause harm.",
