    "instructions.characters.introduction": "If you've made it this far, you might have noticed that the traits of the characters don't match the type of offense used in their jokes, but rather quite the opposite. Joke-O-Meter does not intend to denounce those who laugh at a wicked joke, nor does it want to mock disadvantaged groups. Depending on the joke —and sometimes the context— some jokes can cause harm; in the same way, a joke can be a tool to overcome difficult situations. Joke-O-Meter aims to approach the problem from a kind perspective, and if we manage to make someone reflect with a smile, we consider it a huge win. Below you will find a list of traits and the type of offense of their jokes.",

    "instructions.motivation.description": "The motivation arises from a discussion about whether a joke, or humor in general, can cause harm. There are those who maintain that no one should be offended by a joke, other people believe that certain humor fuels social violence. It is a reality that there are disadvantaged groups that need emotional support from society, and it is also true that humor can be a tool to overcome difficult situations. Where is the limit? Joke-O-Meter aims to approach the problem from a kind point of view, without forgetting that humor is a powerful tool that can be used to cause harm.",
