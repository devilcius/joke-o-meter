    "instructions.characters.introduction": "If you've made it this far, you may have noticed that the characters' traits don't match the type of offense used in their jokes. It's as if the arsenal of wicked jokes doesn't define the character. Telling an offensive joke doesn't make you a bad person, does it? I guess it depends on the intent, and a thousand other factors. Unless you've been assigned the Diabolical character, in which case I would get it checked out.",

    "instructions.motivation.description": "The motivation arises from a discussion about whether a joke, or humor in general, can cause harm. There are those who maintain that no one should be offended by a joke, other people believe that certain humor fuels social violence. It is a reality that there are disadvantaged groups that need emotional support from society, and it is also true that humor can be a tool to overcome difficult situations. Where is the limit? Joke-O-Meter aims to approach the problem from a kind point of view, without forgetting that humor is a powerful tool that can be used to cause harm.",
